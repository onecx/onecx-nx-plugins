== Configure the search criteria 
Once you have generated the search page now you can add the criteria, by which the user can filter the search results. In order to pass the desired criteria to the backend (BFF), they should be specified in OpenAPI specification of BFF endpoint. In order to use those criteria in the UI, the typescript representation of same criteria needs to be specified.  The search criteria can be entered through HTML input fields, which will be placed on the top part of the page.

[#action-1]
=== ACTION S1: OpenAPI specification of search criteria in BFF endpoint


You should have a xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+Search<Feature>Request+`]  defined in the OpenAPI specification, which should be in file xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+<feature>-bff.yaml+`]. 
By modifying xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+<feature>-bff.yaml+`] file, you can add additional parameters to your search request.

For each seach criteria there should be a specification in OpenAPI file (either on top-level or in sub data structures) as described in the section {adding_search_criteria_general_cookbook_url}[ "OpenAPI specification of search criteria in BFF endpoint" of the cookbook].

After updating the OpenAPI specification, execute the command *npm run apigen* to generate the corresponding TypeScript code.

[#action-2]
=== ACTION S2: Search criteria representation in typescript parameters
In order to use search criteria, which you just defined in "ACTION S1", you need to modify the file, containing typescript representation of the search parameters. 
Such file should be called xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+<feature>-search.parameters.ts+`]. There you need to define the members for your xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+<Feature>SearchCriteriasSchema+`].

For each search criteria refer to the {adding_search_criteria_general_parameters_cookbook_url}["Search criteria representation in typescript parameters" section of "Adding search criteria" cookbook].

[#action-3]
=== ACTION S3: HTML input fields for search criteria
In order to make the search criteria visible to the end user, you need to modify HTML view, located in the file called xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+<feature>-search.component.html+`].
Please specify your desired search criterias by adding HTML input fields. You can add different types of input fields, like `+Text+`, `+Calendar+`, `+Dropdown+`,
`+MultiSelect+`, `+AutoComplete+` etc. For each search criteria go through the {adding_search_criteria_general_html_url}["HTML input fields for search criteria" section of "Adding search criteria" cookbook].

[#action-4]
=== ACTION S4: Add translations
The translations in German and English languages should be defined in corresponding files: `+de.json+` / `+en.json+`

Please ensure that all input field labels have the necessary translations added.
Refer to the {adding_translations_cookbook_url}[cookbook describing translations].
