=== Configure the search results. 
To configure the search results, the following actions must be taken. 

=== ACTION S6: Add additional properties to the <feature>-bff.yaml

* The <FeatureName>SearchResult data structure in the BFF yaml must be adapted. 

** All the data that should be displayed in the results must be in that data structure either on top-level or in sub data structures. 

** The data should be as minimal as possible to not create to much load to the backend and DB. 

**  The parameters of the search endpoint in the BFF yaml must be adapted

*Where this snippet can be found*: <feature>-bff.yaml. :

----
TestFeatureSearchResult:
      type: object
      required:
        - "testFeature"
      properties:
        testFeature:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/TestFeature"
        # ACTION S6: add additional properties here if needed
----
Here you can add additional properties which you need for your <SearchFeatureRequest> / <SearchFeatureResult>, e.g. status, creationDate ...

=== ACTION S7: Define search results columns

The column mappings must be defined. 

*Where this snippet can be found*: <feature>-search.component.ts. :

[subs=+macros]
----
export const <%= featurePropertyName %>SearchColumns = [
      {
      columnType: ColumnType.STANDARD,
      id: 'id',
      nameKey: 'TRANSLATION_STRING',
      filterable: true,
      sortable: true,
      predefinedGroupKeys: [
        // Please replace FEATURE with the name of your feature 
        'FEATURE_SEARCH.PREDEFINED_GROUP.DEFAULT',
        'FEATURE_SEARCH.PREDEFINED_GROUP.EXTENDED',
        'FEATURE_SEARCH.PREDEFINED_GROUP.FULL',
      ],
    },
]
----
Explanation of the properties:

**	The columnType defines the type of the column. The following column types are available:
[subs=+macros]
----
export const enum ColumnType {
  STRING = 'STRING',
  NUMBER = 'NUMBER',
  DATE = 'DATE',
  RELATIVE_DATE = 'RELATIVE_DATE',
  TRANSLATION_KEY = 'TRANSLATION_KEY',
}
----
** The property 'id' provides the property of the column
* The property 'nameKey' provides the translation string. Furthermore, the translation needs to be added to the de.json and en.json file.
* The property 'filterable' indicates if the column is filterable
* The property 'sortable' indicates if the column is sortable
* The property 'predefinedGroupKeys' defines in which group sets the following column is available. Furthermore, the predefinedGroups can be selected in a dropdown on top of the search results table. If you want that your searchColumn only belongs to your default column group, then only add  'FEATURE_SEARCH.PREDEFINED_GROUP.DEFAULT'

=== ACTION S8: Here you can create a mapping of the items and their corresponding translation strings

*Where this snippet can be found*: <feature>-search.selectors.ts :
[subs=+macros]
----
export const selectResults = createSelector(
  <%= featurePropertyName %>SearchSelectors.selectResults,
  (results): RowListGridData[] => {
    return results.map((item) => ({
      id: item.<%= featurePropertyName %>.id,
      imagePath: '',
      ...item,
      // ACTION S8: Here you can create a mapping of the items and their corresponding translation strings
    }));
  }
);
