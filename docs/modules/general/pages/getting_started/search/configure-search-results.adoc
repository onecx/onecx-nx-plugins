You can configure what columns will be shown in the result table after entering the search criteria clicking search button. 
For that you need to make sure that desired result fields are included into OpneApi specification of result object. Also you should provide representation of the results for fields specified in openAPI. The information in the result table should be properly translated. There is a possibility to display a diagram of statistical values for particular column. For that you need to provide the identifier of desired column.

=== ACTION S5: OpenAPI specification of result object in BFF endpoint

If you need to add additional properties to your response object xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+Search<Feature>Response+`], you can do that by modifying OpenAPI specification file xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+<feature>-bff.yaml+`].
There the xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+<Feature>+`] data object structure can be adapted.

Note that:

* If you have chosen a custom DataObjectName in the generation, the schema entry will be named accordingly.
* All the data that should be displayed in the results must be in that data structure either on top-level or in sub data structures. 
* The data should be as minimal as possible to not create too much load to the backend and the DB. 

Please refer to the {adding_results_cookbook_url}["Adding search results" cookbook] for more information.

After updating the OpenAPI specification, execute the command *npm run apigen* to generate the corresponding TypeScript code.

[#action-6]
=== ACTION S6: Results representation in typescript
In order to use the fields of search results, defined in OpenAPI specification, you need to modify the file, containing typescript representation of the search result columns. 
Such file should be called xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+<feature>-search.columns.ts+`]. There you need to define the members for your xref:getting_started/explanations.adoc#feature[`+<Feature>SearchColumns+`].

Refer to the {adding_results_columns_cookbook_url}[cookbook regarding "Columns of Result Data Table"] for more information.

=== ACTION S7: Mapping of the items and respective translations

In `+<feature>-search.selectors.ts+` file you can create a mapping of the items and their corresponding translation strings for columns with type `TRANSLATION_KEY` to translate the values in the talbe rows respective to the column. You can do that with help of selectors.

Refer to the {adding_results_translations_cookbook_url}[cookbook regarding "Translations for Columns with Type TRANSLATION_KEY"] for more information.

=== ACTION S8: Add translation

Please ensure that all column headers and the values in columns with the type `TRANSLATION_KEY` have the necessary translations added to corresponding files `+de.json+` / `+en.json+` for German and English translations.

Refer to the {adding_translations_cookbook_url}[cookbook for more information regarding translations].

=== ACTION S9: Select the column to be displayed in the diagram

By default, a diagram is created which counts the different values in a column and shows the results. To use this diagram, the column which should be displayed needs to be selected first. You need to provide the id of the column for which the diagram should be displayed in the typescript component located in file `+<feature>-search.component.ts+`. Diagram then shows the distribution of data of the selected column.
In the HTML view the diagram and results data table can either placed after one another, by selecting vertical layout, or they can be placed next to each other, side by side, by selecting horizontal layout.

Please refer to the {adding_results_diagram_cookbook_url}[cookbook] for more details.
