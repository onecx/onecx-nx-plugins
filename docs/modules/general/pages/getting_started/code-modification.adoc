=== Automated Code Modification in Your Application

==== Overview
During code generation and updates, the system may automatically modify existing files to insert new components, routes, or configurations. The `safeReplace` mechanism ensures these modifications are applied safely and provides feedback in case of any issues.

==== How It Works
1. When a new feature is generated, existing files are scanned for known patterns.
2. If a matching pattern is found, it is updated with the new content.
3. If an issue occurs (e.g., pattern not found), the system:
   * Leaves a comment in the affected file describing the issue.
   * Logs the error for developers to manually resolve.

==== What This Means for You
* You might notice auto-generated comments in certain files indicating that a modification attempt was unsuccessful.
* These comments will contain specific instructions for resolving the issue manually.
* If everything works as expected, you won't see any errors, and your application will seamlessly integrate new features.

==== Example of an Error Message
If a replacement fails, you may find a comment like this in your code:
[source,typescript]
----
// Generator Failure occurred!
// The goal of the generation was to: Add new feature X
//
// The following replacements failed:
// Could not find the pattern: routes: Routes = [. Attempted to replace with: routes: Routes = [ { path: 'details/:id', component: ${className}DetailsComponent, pathMatch: 'full' },
//
// Please perform the replacements manually.
----

==== What to Do If You See This
1. Open the affected file.
2. Follow the instructions in the comment to manually apply the required change.
3. If unsure, consult the development team or refer to the feature documentation.
