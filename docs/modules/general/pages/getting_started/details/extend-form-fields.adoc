=== (Edit) Extend form fields

:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

:page_header_url: xref:latest@guides:angular:cookbook/components/page-header/index.adoc

The core data must be added to the header of the details page.

[#action-2]
==== ACTION DE1: Extend schemas inside OpenAPI
_Adapt in File:_  `+<feature>-bff.yaml+`

Similar to the create-update generation, you can adapt the schema for update requests, see xref:getting_started/create-update/extend-form-fields.adoc[Extend form fields].

For the details page, the generator also creates 2 actions for the header by default. Consider adding custom actions to be available in the header via `headerActions$` property. Please, reference the {page_header_url}[PageHeader docs] for more information on the `Action` usage.
