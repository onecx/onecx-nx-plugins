= Create a UI App

What is a UI App?::
A UI App is a microfrontend application built using modern web technologies such as {angular_link} or {react_link}. Such application is designed to seamlessly integrate with the OneCX platform, providing a consistent user experience across different modules and features.
+
Within the OneCX ecosystem, a UI App typically serves as the front-end interface for users to interact with various functionalities offered by OneCX. It can be a standalone application or part of a larger suite of applications, and it communicates with backend services to fetch and display data, handle user inputs, and perform various operations.

[NOTE]
====
The UI App created with the OneCX App Generator is only the base of a functional application. +
You will need to further develop and customize the application to meet your specific requirements and business logic.

== Generate a UI App

The generator supports three flavors of projects: *angular*, *with NgRx* and *without NgRx*. +
It is **recommended to use the NgRx** flavor, because it leads to better structured projects and the state management is already in place.

.Generate the UI App with following commands
[source,bash]
----
npx <namespace>/create-workspace <flavor> <product> 
cd <product>
npm install
----

with:
[horizontal]
ifdef::env-site[]
include::partial$_parameter.adoc[tag=namespace]
include::partial$_parameter.adoc[tag=flavor]
include::partial$_parameter.adoc[tag=product]
endif::[]

The generator will create a new workspace folder with the specified product name and set up the OneCX UI App according to the chosen flavor. +

== Example

.Create a UI App named "book-store" with NgRx support
[source,bash]
----
npx @onecx/create-workspace ngrx book-store
cd book-store
npm install
----
This command will generate a new workspace folder named "book-store" with the necessary structure and configurations for a OneCX UI App using NgRx.
