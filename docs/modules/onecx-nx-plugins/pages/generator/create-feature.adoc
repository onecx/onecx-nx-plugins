= Create a Feature Module 

What is a Feature Module?::
A Feature Module is a modular unit of functionality that encapsulates a specific feature or set of related features within an UI Application. +
It is designed to promote code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns by grouping related components, services, and state management logic together. +
+In Angular, feature modules are NgModules for the purpose of organizing code.+

[NOTE]
====
The Feature Module created with the OneCX App Generator is only the base of a functional module. +
You will need to further develop and customize the module to meet your specific requirements and business logic.
====


== Generate a Feature Module

.To run the generator, execute the following command
[source,bash]
----
nx generate <namespaceOfTheGenerator>/nx-plugin:feature  <feature>
----
 
with:
[horizontal]
ifdef::env-site[]
include::partial$_parameter.adoc[tag=namespace]
include::partial$_parameter.adoc[tag=feature]
endif::[]

The generator will create a new feature module with the specified name and set up the necessary structure and configurations.


== Example

Create a Feature Module inside the application named "book-store" to manage customer data. Execute the following command with the book-store application as current working directory.

.Create a Feature Module named "customer-management"
[source,bash]
----
nx generate @onecx/nx-plugin:feature customer-management
----

This command will generate a new feature module named "customer-management" with the necessary structure and configurations.
