:idprefix:
:idseparator: -

The fastest way to create a new feature module that works with OneCX you can use the OneCX generator.
include::partial$generator-check.adoc[]

******
To run the generator, execute the following command:
----
nx generate <namespaceOfTheGenerator>/nx-plugin:feature <feature>
----
 
include::partial$_generator-namespace.adoc[]

* _<feature>_: see xref:./glossary.adoc#feature[here].

******

After running the generator, the following actions must be taken: 
[start=1]
. xref:./feature/further-actions.adoc[Check for further actions]
. xref:./feature/commit-changes.adoc[Commit the changes]
