= Create a Simple NgRx Page

This guide describes how to create a simple NgRx page using the OneCX App Generator.

A simple NgRx page refers to an *NgRx component* with its associated state management (actions, reducers, effects, selectors), but without specific business logic or UI elements. Only a page title is displayed. +
This can be done if you have already set up an initial Application with an feature.

[NOTE]
====
When we talk about creating a simple NgRx page, the generator *creates a page component* as part of a feature module.
====


== Create NgRx Page
Follow these steps:

. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your OneCX application where you want to add the new NgRx page.
. Run the following OneCX App Generator command. +
  The feature parameter is optional and can be used to specify the feature module where the NgRx page should be created. If not provided, the generator prompt you to specify a feature module.
+
.Generate page/component
[source, bash]
----
nx generate @onecx/nx-plugin:ngrx-page [feature module]
----
. Follow the prompts to provide details like the page component name and the page title. +
  That's it.
. Navigate in your browser to the new component using the the component name as route.

== Example
To create a simple NgRx page named "Hello" under the "Hello World" feature module, you would run:

.Generate page/component
[source, bash]
----
nx generate @onecx/nx-plugin:ngrx-page hello-world
----
When prompted, you would enter "Hello" as the component name and "Hello World" as the page title. +
To access the newly created component, navigate to `[text-important]#<your app-base-path>/hello-world/hello#` in your browser.

.OneCX Local Environment with Hello Component
