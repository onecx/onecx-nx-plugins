= OneCX Generator

With the OneCX generator, you can develop a new application. And in this generated application, a feature module, a search page and a details page can be added.

This generator does generate OpenAPI code for its corresponding UI.
By using the generated OpenAPI code as a basis, you can develop your BFF (and SVC).

== How to use the Generator(s)
To generate a full application you need to run several generators in a specific order, as some depend on others:

* OneCX App
** Feature Module
*** Search Page
**** Create-Update Dialog
**** Delete Dialog
*** Details Page
*** Empty NGRX Page
** Pre Commit Validation
